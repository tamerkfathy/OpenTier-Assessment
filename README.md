## Server Implementation Analysis Report
# 1. Test Suite Results Analysis
 The updated implementation successfully passes all test cases that were previously marked as ignored:
•	test_client_connection
•	test_client_echo_message
•	test_multiple_echo_messages
•	test_multiple_clients
•	test_client_add_request
# The test suite demonstrates robust handling of:
•	Single client connections
•	Multiple sequential messages
•	Concurrent client connections
•	Addition request functionality
•	Connection management and cleanup

## 2. Bug Analysis and Fixes
 Initial Implementation Bugs
# 1.	Limited Buffer Size 
o	Original: Fixed 512-byte buffer size
o	Fix: Increased to 1024 bytes for larger message handling
# 2.	Connection Handling 
o	Original: Single-threaded blocking connections
o	Fix: Implemented non-blocking accept with proper error handling
# 3.	Resource Management 
o	Original: No proper cleanup of client connections
o	Fix: Added structured thread management and cleanup mechanisms
# 4.	Error Handling 
o	Original: Basic error propagation
o	Fix: Enhanced error handling with proper logging and client disconnection handling

## 3. Architectural Improvements
# Threading Model
•	Implemented a thread-per-client model using std::thread
•	Added thread management using Arc<parking_lot::Mutex<Vec<JoinHandle>>>
•	Implemented proper thread cleanup on server shutdown
# Connection Management
•	Added non-blocking listener with proper sleep intervals
•	Implemented proper client disconnection detection
•	Added thread-safe shutdown mechanism
# Memory Management
•	Implemented thread-safe shared state using Arc
•	Added proper resource cleanup in the Server drop implementation
•	Improved buffer management for message handling
# Synchronization
•	Used atomic boolean for server state management
•	Implemented thread-safe client collection using parking_lot::Mutex
•	Added proper synchronization for shared resources
