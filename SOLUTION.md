# Solution

## Solution Documentation
# Initial Analysis
The original server implementation contained several critical design flaws and bugs that limited its functionality and reliability.
This document outlines the identified issues and the implemented solutions.
# Identified Issues
# Design Flaws
The server's original architecture had several fundamental limitations:

1. Single-Threaded Design
   The original implementation processed client connections sequentially, preventing true concurrent client handling.
   This design created a bottleneck where each client had to wait for others to complete their operations before being served.
2. Connection Management
   The server lacked proper connection cleanup mechanisms, potentially leading to resource leaks when clients disconnected 
   unexpectedly. Additionally, the connection acceptance loop didn't properly handle connection errors or client disconnections.
3. Message Processing
   The original implementation only supported EchoMessage types and lacked support for other message types defined
   in the protocol buffer specification, such as AddRequest messages.
4. Resource Management
   The server didn't properly manage system resources, particularly in terms of thread handling and cleanup 
   during shutdown operations.

# Technical Bugs
Several technical issues were identified and resolved:

1. Socket Binding Issues

- The server attempted to bind to a fixed port (8080) without considering port availability
- No fallback mechanism existed for when the primary port was unavailable
- Lack of proper error handling for binding failures


2. Buffer Management

- Fixed buffer size of 512 bytes limited message size
- No handling of partial reads or writes
- Potential buffer overflow risks


3. Protocol Implementation

- Incomplete implementation of the protocol buffer message types
- Missing support for AddRequest/AddResponse message types
- No validation of message integrity
